the GUI Interface<br>
<br>
<small><small><small>To
talk to Rufus, enter text in the top box and hit the "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Submit</span>"
button.<br>
<br>
By default, Rufus stores all newly learned facts in temporary memory.
To store a fact in permanent memory, enter your fact in the window and
hit the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Record
Perm</span>" button. To erase the
temporary memory and start fresh, hit the "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CLR Context</span>"
button.<br>
<br>
With the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit
Phrases</span>" button, you can add,
modify, and delete phrases from the phrase file. The important thing to
remember is that the phrases are searched in order, starting at #1. So
if a certain input matches two phrases in the phrase file, the one that
is first will be matched and the second one will be ignored. So the
rule of thumb is to place the phrases with more fixed words in them
first.<br>
<br>
The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span>"
button lets you play with the various voices and properties that the
Mac's text to speech sythesizer has available.</small></small></small></big></big></big>
