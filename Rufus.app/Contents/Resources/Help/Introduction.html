Everyone has heard of Artificial Intelligence these days. It's one of
those things that you see in the movies, and it makes so much
sense,&nbsp;you just know that one day it will be invented by
someone. Well I got tired of waiting on someone else to invent it. I
wanted something that I could tinker with and bring some of my ideas
about AI to life. For one thing, I felt that the traditional approaches
to achieve AI were either too simple or too complicated. Take chatbots
for instance. They are too simple. Tell a chatbot your name. Then
immediately ask it your name. Most of the simple chatbots will fail. On
the other hand, if an AI program is trying to diagram a sentence the
way your english teacher taught you, I feel that this is over
complicated. The human
mind doesn't learn language that way, why should a computer?</small></small></small></big></big></big>
