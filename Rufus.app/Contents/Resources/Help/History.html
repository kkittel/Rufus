<big><big><big>History
of Rufus<br>
<br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rufus was created over 15 years ago. Actually it evolved rather than
was created. It started out as the Simplified Natural Language
Understanding Program, or Snlup for short. It was written in C, and ran
under Dos on a&nbsp;Windows machine. It was command line driven. I
also had a command line driven version running on Unix. This is when I
created the scripting language for the Snlup. This proved very useful. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then I created a program which ran under Windows and showed the various
files which the Snlup uses. This was very useful for debugging the
program, and was a big improvement. I also hooked up the Snlup to a
text to speech backend, and also experimented hooking it up to voice
recognition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day I decided to get a new
computer and I chose a Macintosh. So then I ported the Snlup to the
Mac. I also created a version called Memapp that ran on an iPhone or
iPod Touch. On the Mac, I merged the Snlup with Apple's text to speech
program, NSSpeechSynthesizerExample, and this gave the Snlup a voice
and a face. I named the creation Rufus to give it some personality. I
also wrote DebugSnlup which again showed the various files that the
program uses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to this point, I had been editing the
phrases file by hand. I always felt this would be easier with a
program, so I added this to Rufus. Now you are able to add and modify
phrases by using a GUI interface.</small></small></small></big></big></big>
