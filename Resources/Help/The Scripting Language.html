Scripting Language<br>
<br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rufus has a primitive built-in scripting language. It is incomplete and
doesn't work very well. You will find example scripts in the data
folder. The script names must end in ".scr". You can use a text editor
to view the example scripts or create new ones. To run a script in the
data folder, say "run script &lt;scriptname&gt;" to Rufus.
Also, you can create any phrase to run a script. Look up the phrase
"knock knock" for an example. If you type "knock knock" into Rufus, you
can tell him a knock knock joke and he will laugh.<br>
<br>
This is an example of a simple sript file:<br>
<br>
echo whos there<br>
wait for input suppress actions<br>
&lt;name&gt; = &lt;object1&gt;<br>
echo &lt;name&gt; who<br>
wait for input suppress actions<br>
echo Ha Ha Ha!!!<br>
<br>
echo repeats the text to the screen.<br>
wait for input spress actions - waits for input and does not process it
as it normally would<br>
&lt;name&gt; = &lt;object1&gt; - assignment of variable
&lt;name&gt; to &lt;object1&gt;<br>
<br>
So this script lets you tell Rufus a knock knock joke and then he will
laugh.<br>
<br>
To fully understand or modify the scripting language that Rufus uses,
see the scripts.m file.</small></small></small></big></big></big>
