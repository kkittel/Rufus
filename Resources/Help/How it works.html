it Works<br>
<br>
<small><small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rufus uses pattern matching, logic, memory,&nbsp;substitution, and
searching to achieve its Artificial Intelligence. At the heart of the
pattern matching is the concept of &lt;object&gt; phrase
&lt;object&gt;, where &lt;object&gt; can be one or more
words, or even another sentence altogether. Phrase is a fixed phrase.
The phrases which the program uses to do its pattern matching are kept
in a table, or file. For instance, a phrase might be
&lt;object&gt; is &lt;object&gt;. So if the input to
the program is "The ball is yellow" it would match that as &lt;the
ball&gt; is &lt;yellow&gt;. &nbsp;Object1 is
&lt;the ball&gt; and object2 is &lt;yellow&gt;. The
action for this phrase tells the program to store this phrase in
temperary memory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we could tell the Snlup that
"Yellow is a color". It would match that as &lt;yellow&gt; is
&lt;a color&gt; and store it in memory. Then if we ask it "What
color is the ball" it would match as what &lt;color&gt; is
&lt;the ball&gt;. It will use substitution to replace
&lt;color&gt; with &lt;yellow&gt; and upon searching
memory for &lt;the ball&gt; and &lt;yellow&gt;, will
find the fact that has been stored, "The ball is yellow".</small></small></small></big></big></big>
